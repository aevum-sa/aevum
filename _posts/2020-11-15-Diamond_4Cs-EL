## Εδώ θα μπει το ελληνικό Version

The renowned diamond is a mineral of great commercial value all around the world, which comes down to its hardness and luster, characteristics that set it apart and render it greatly sought after. In their natural state, diamonds are translucent, transparent or opaque and their colors vary. There are diamonds that are colorless, pink, yellow, sky blue, and even black.

## Weight
The weight of a diamond, and any other gemstone, is measured in carats (ct). Each carat is equivalent to 0,20 grams. The bigger the stone, the higher its price since large stones are more rare.

## Color
Grading a diamond’s color is all about the absence of color. You might be wondering “how does that make sense?” In fact, it’s quite simple; a chemically “clean” and structurally perfect diamond is colorless, and thus more expensive.

The color of a diamond ranges from completely colorless to yellow. The difference in shade between diamonds is so hard to perceive that it’s invisible to the untrained eye. Despite that, those tiny variations play a very important role in the quality and worth of a diamond.

## Clarity
Clarity concerns the existence or absence of “inclusions,” small defects and imperfections within a diamond, and whether those are visible. Another factor that makes a diamond special, other than its shine and beauty, is its uniqueness, since it’s impossible for two identical diamonds, with the same  elements in the exact same places, to exist.
**Below you can see all the possible clarity ratings a diamond can have:**

* **Loupe Clean (LC) / Flawless (FL)**: Flawless, without any visible inclusions when viewed at 10× zoom.
* **Internally Flawless (IF)**: Contains no visible inclusions when viewed at 10× zoom.
* **Very Very Small inclusions (VVS1/VVS2 )**: Contains tiny inclusions that are hard to detect even by an experiences grader when viewed at 10× zoom.
* **Very Small inclusions (VS1/VS2)**: Contains inclusions that are easy to see when viewed at 10× zoom but are hardly important.
* **Small Inclusions (SI1/SI2)**: Contains detectable inclusions when viewed at 10× zoom.
* **Pique or Included (P1/I1, P2/I2, P3/I3)**: Contains inclusions that are unmissable when viewed at 10× zoom and are often visible to the naked eye. This kind of inclusion can severely affect the clearness as well as the shine of a diamond.

## Cut
Diamonds have certain properties, like their hardness, ability to reflect light and, of course, shine. Grading a diamond’s cut is about evaluating how much the way they’ve been cut helps bring out those properties. The amount of light reflected is related to the proportions, the symmetry and the polish of a diamond. The closer to perfect that those characteristics are, the more light the diamond can reflect.
The quality of the cut is important not only when it comes to the final appearance, but also the worth of a diamond, something that’s complex to determine since many factors play a role. The Brightness, Fire and Scintillation all have something to do with the appearance of the diamond. The Symmetry, Polish and Proportions are about its design.
Taking into account the factors above, a diamond’s Cut can be characterized as either of the terms below:
* Excellent
* Very Good
* Good
* Poor/Faint

The worse the Cut, the less light can circulate, which results in less light reaching our eyes and thus a weaker shine.
